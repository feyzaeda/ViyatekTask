[{		"description": "During the 1870s, two well-known inventors both independently designed devices that could transmit sound along with electrical cables. Those inventors were Alexander Graham Bell and Elisha Gray. Both devices were registered at the patent office within hours of each other. There followed a bitter legal battle over the invention of the telephone, which Bell subsequently won.\r\n\r\nThe telegraph and telephone are very similar in concept, and it was through Bell's attempts to improve the telegraph that he found success with the telephone.\r\n\r\nThe telegraph had been a highly successful communication system for about 30 years before Bell began experimenting. The main problem with the telegraph was that it used Morse code, and was limited to sending and receiving one message at a time. Bell had a good understanding of the nature of sound and music. This enabled him to perceive the possibility of transmitting more than one message along the same wire at one time. Bell's idea was not new, others before him had envisaged multiple telegraphs. Bell offered his own solution, the \"Harmonic Telegraph\". This was based on the principle that musical notes could be sent simultaneously down the same wire if those notes differed in pitch.\r\n\r\nBy the latter part of 1874 Bell's experiment had progressed enough for him to inform close family members about the possibility of multiple telegraphs. Bell's future father in law, attorney Gardiner Green Hubbard saw the opportunity to break the monopoly exerted by the Western Union Telegraph Company. He gave Bell the financial backing required for him to carry on his work developing the multiple telegraphs. However, Bell failed to mention that he and his accomplice, another brilliant young electrician Thomas Watson, were developing an idea that occurred to him during the summer. This idea was to create a device that could transmit the human voice electrically.\r\n\r\nBell and Watson continued to work on the harmonic telegraph at the insistence of Hubbard and a few other financial backers. During March 1875 Bell met with a man called Joseph Henry without the knowledge of Hubbard. Joseph Henry was the respected director of the Smithsonian Institution. He listened closely to Bell's ideas and offered words of encouragement. Both Bell and Watson were spurred on by Henry's opinions and continued their work with even greater enthusiasm and determination. By June 1875 they realized their goal of creating a device that could transmit speech electrically would soon be realized. Their experiments had proven different tones would vary the strength of an electric current in a wire.",		"fact": "Music was sent down a telephone line for the first time in 1876, the year the phone was invented.",		"id": "1070",		"isPremium": 0,		"last_update": "2021-08-08 10:39:12",		"source": "http://www.nationalitpa.com/history-of-telephone",		"title": "Music in Telephone Line",		"topic": "Music",		"topic_id": "12"	},	{		"description": "Like many famous songs, Nirvana's seminal hit Smells Like Teen Spirit has an unusual history. For starters, the author of the 1991 song (Nirvana's lead singer Kurt Cobain) did not know what the term \"teen spirit\" meant when he used it as the title; he thought it was an arcane anti-establishment motto, when in fact it was the name of a mildly popular deodorant aimed at young females.\r\n\r\nSmells Like Teen Spirit is generally conceded to be one of the most epochal songs in the history of rock'n roll. This is because it constitutes the fault line separating the \"alternative\", grunge era of the early Nineties from the \"hair-band\" era of the Eighties. As has been noted before, Nirvana was both the kiss of death and the death of Kiss. Grunge had been around for quite some time before Kurt Cobain showed up, but Smells Like Teen Spirit was more catchy and sophisticated than the average grunge song. It was both primitive and complex, both cerebral and coarse. From the moment MTV began playing the grainy, bizarre Teen Spirit video on a late-night program devoted to music it didn't really expect its audience to enjoy, the inane, interchangeably pointless hair bands that had dominated the previous decade understood that their time had passed. Except for Bon Jovi.\r\n\r\nNo one knows where the riff that defines Smells Like Teen Spirit comes from, other than from Kurt Cobain's head. But the phrase \"smells like teen spirit\" had been scrawled on the wall of his apartment by Katherine Hanna, the lead singer of the band Bikini Kill. Hanna wrote this as a joke because her bandmate Tobi Vail, who happened to be Cobain's girlfriend at the time, was a fan of the Teen Spirit deodorant. Teen Spirit was manufactured by the Mennen Corporation, which had developed a line of very popular, somewhat \"alternative\" deodorants for men in the 1960s.\r\n\r\nBecause Bikini Kill was recorded on the Kill Rock Stars label and was generally contemptuous of mainstream American society, Cobain mistook the phrase for a seditious catchphrase, like \"\u00c0 Nous La Liberte!\" or \"El Pueblo Unido Jamas Sera Vencido.\" Cobain, it will be recalled, grew up in suburban Washington State, which had no history of sedition, is best known for logging, fishing, anomie, and precipitation. When Cobain found out what Teen Spirit was, he was highly upset and very possibly humiliated, but as he didn't live very long, naming a song after a well-liked deodorant probably didn't hurt his career.",		"fact": "Kurt Cobain accidentally named Nirvana's \"Smells Like Teen Spirit\" after a deodorant for teenage girls.",		"id": "1089",		"isPremium": 0,		"last_update": "2021-06-05 10:33:02",		"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2007/jul/19/popandrock.nirvana",		"title": "Smells Like Teen Spirit",		"topic": "Music",		"topic_id": "12"	},	{		"description": "Fifty years to start growing acorns seems like an immense amount of time. Pollination between the male and female flowers of the tree plays a role in how long it takes for the acorn fruit to begin blooming.\r\n\r\nThe majority of oak trees do indeed bloom acorns well before the age of 50. \"Most species of oaks begin producing acorns at about 20 years old.
